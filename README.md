# Alexandria
Alexandria is a book list and barcode scanner app. I contributed to the original project by integrating [Mobile Vision API](https://developers.google.com/vision/) to implement the barcode scanning functionality. This contribution was submitted as a final project of the third Android Developer Nanodegree course on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## Dependencies
* Google Play Services 8.1.0 and higher

## Installation
1. Clone the Alexandria repository.
2. Open the cloned project in Android Studio and build it.
